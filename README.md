## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a bit tough web page for me as a beginner, it consisted some basic use of HTML and CSS but some components like the floating box were asking for intermediate CSS skills (ofcourse I took help from Internet), now I learnt what things to use where like the position attribute and such things. Altough I will need to work on such projects more to get a hang of these things.
